# API "Degraded" Status - Explained & Fixed

## 🟡 What is "Degraded" Status?

When you see:
```
⚠ API status is degraded (Phoenix global credentials not set)
✓ Workers and queue are healthy - tests can proceed
```

This means:
- ✅ **Core services working**: API, Workers, Redis all operational
- ⚠️  **No global Phoenix credentials**: Service doesn't have default Phoenix credentials
- ✅ **Tests will work**: You're providing credentials per-request via `test_config.yaml`

---

## 🎯 Two Options

### **Option 1: Accept "Degraded" Status** ✅ (Default - Already Fixed!)

**When to use**: When you provide Phoenix credentials per-request (which you are!)

**Status**: 
- Tests will run successfully
- Test runner now accepts "degraded" as valid
- No changes needed!

**How it works**:
```yaml
# test_config.yaml provides credentials per upload:
phoenix_client_id: YOUR_PHOENIX_CLIENT_ID
phoenix_client_secret: YOUR_PHOENIX_CLIENT_SECRET
phoenix_api_url: https://api.demo.appsecphx.io
```

Each test upload sends these credentials to the API, which then uses them.

---

### **Option 2: Make Service Fully "Healthy"** 🟢 (Optional)

**When to use**: When you want the service to have default credentials

**How to**: Add Phoenix credentials to the service's `.env` file

#### **Step 1: Edit Service .env**
```bash
cd ../phoenix-scanner-service
nano .env
```

#### **Step 2: Add These Lines** (if not already there)
```bash
# Phoenix API Credentials (from your test_config.yaml)
PHOENIX_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_PHOENIX_CLIENT_ID
PHOENIX_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_PHOENIX_CLIENT_SECRET
PHOENIX_API_URL=https://api.demo.appsecphx.io
```

#### **Step 3: Restart Service**
```bash
make restart
# or
docker-compose restart
```

#### **Step 4: Verify**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8001/api/v1/health | jq .status
# Should now show: "healthy"
```

## 📊 Status Comparison

| Status | Meaning | Workers | Queue | Phoenix Creds | Tests Work? |
|--------|---------|---------|-------|---------------|-------------|
| **healthy** 🟢 | Perfect | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Global set | ✅ Yes |
| **degraded** 🟡 | Functional | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️  Not global | ✅ Yes (with per-request creds) |
| **unhealthy** 🔴 | Broken | ❌ or ✅ | ❌ | Any | ❌ No |

## 🔧 What Changed in run_tests.py

### **Before** (Strict):
```python
if health.get('status') == 'healthy':
    console.print("[green]✓[/green] API is healthy\n")
else:
    console.print(f"[red]✗[/red] API health check failed: {health}\n")
    raise Exception("API is not healthy")  # ❌ Would fail on "degraded"
```

### **After** (Smart):
```python
status = health.get('status')
workers_ok = health.get('workers', {}).get('status') == 'healthy'
queue_ok = health.get('queue', {}).get('redis_status') == 'healthy'

if status == 'healthy':
    console.print("[green]✓[/green] API is healthy\n")
elif status == 'degraded' and workers_ok and queue_ok:
    console.print("[yellow]⚠[/yellow] API status is degraded")
    console.print("[green]✓[/green] Workers and queue are healthy - tests can proceed\n")
    # ✅ Accepts degraded when core services work
else:
    console.print(f"[red]✗[/red] API health check failed: {health}\n")
    raise Exception("API is not healthy")
```

**Now checks**:
1. Is status "healthy"? → Perfect! ✅
2. Is status "degraded" BUT workers & queue healthy? → Acceptable! ✅
3. Anything else? → Error! ❌

## 🧪 Test the Fix

### **Run Tests Now**:
```bash
cd /Users/francescocipollone/Documents/GitHub/autoconfig-priv-latest/Utils/Loading_Script_V5_PUB/unit_tests

python3 run_tests.py --config test_config.yaml
```

### **Expected Output**:
```
═══ Phoenix Scanner Test Suite ═══

Testing API connection...
⚠ API status is degraded (Phoenix global credentials not set)
✓ Workers and queue are healthy - tests can proceed

Running 16 individual test cases...
[Tests will now proceed...]
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### **Still Getting Error?**

#### **Check Service is Running**:
```bash
cd ../phoenix-scanner-service
docker-compose ps

# Should show:
# phoenix-scanner-api        Up (healthy)
# phoenix-scanner-worker-1   Up
# phoenix-scanner-worker-2   Up
# phoenix-scanner-redis      Up (healthy)
```

#### **Check Health Manually**:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8001/api/v1/health | jq .

# Should show:
# {
#   "status": "degraded" or "healthy",
#   "workers": {
#     "status": "healthy"  ← Must be "healthy"
#   },
#   "queue": {
#     "redis_status": "healthy"  ← Must be "healthy"
#   }
# }
```

#### **If Workers Unhealthy**:
```bash
# Check worker logs
docker logs phoenix-scanner-service-worker-1

# Restart workers
docker-compose restart worker
```

#### **If Queue Unhealthy**:
```bash
# Check Redis
docker logs phoenix-scanner-redis

# Restart Redis
docker-compose restart redis
```

## 💡 Why "Degraded" is Actually Fine

### **Degraded Doesn't Mean Broken**:
```
"degraded" = "Service works, but some non-critical features unavailable"
```

### **What's "Missing" in Degraded**:
- Global default Phoenix credentials
- That's it!

### **What Still Works**:
- ✅ API accepts uploads
- ✅ Workers process files
- ✅ Queue manages jobs
- ✅ You can provide Phoenix credentials per-request
- ✅ **Tests work perfectly!**

### **Real-World Analogy**:
```
Healthy   = Restaurant with default menu + daily specials
Degraded  = Restaurant with daily specials only (you specify each order)
Unhealthy = Restaurant is closed
```

Your tests are the "daily specials" (providing specific credentials each time).

---

## 🎯 Recommended Setup

### **For Testing** (Current):
- ✅ Accept "degraded" status
- ✅ Provide credentials in `test_config.yaml`
- ✅ Tests work perfectly
- ✅ No changes needed!

### **For Production**:
- Add Phoenix credentials to service `.env`
- Get "healthy" status
- Service has default credentials
- Still can override per-request

---

## ✅ Summary

**Fix Applied**: ✅ Test runner now accepts "degraded" status when workers and queue are healthy

**Your Tests**: ✅ Will now run successfully!

**Action Needed**: None! Just run:
```bash
python3 run_tests.py --config test_config.yaml
```

**Optional Upgrade**: Add Phoenix credentials to service `.env` for full "healthy" status

---

**Date**: November 12, 2024  
**Issue**: Test runner rejected "degraded" status  
**Fix**: Updated health check logic to accept "degraded" when core services healthy  
**Status**: ✅ **READY TO RUN TESTS**
